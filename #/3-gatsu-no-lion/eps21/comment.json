But this anime shows us that there's a middleground. In the whole 22 episode Kiriyama's personality hasn't change. Sure he's had his ups and downs, mood swing and the like - but his core personality hasn't changed. Hes the same odd-one-out kid who's socially awkward and overly self-conscious. However what has changed is his drive and goal. He's learnt that shogi is more than just a game. Its an outlet of likeminded people, and a way to make lasting friendships.",
