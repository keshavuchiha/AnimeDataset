And now she got told off that it was all for nothing. If I was in her place, I would definitely quit right at that moment.",

What the 86 said in the episode is that they don't fight for those noble reasons, they fight to survive. Some people like realism in military shows where characters show ptsd, trauma and etc but for the author I think he's going for more of a \"survival of the fittest\" plot.",

I am sure she will mature after this , because she is trying to be a good person and will do everything in her power to help the 86 survive.",

Yes she is trying to help and is marginally better than the rest of the Handlers , but at the end of the day she hasn't changed a thing for them - they are still treated as pigs , forced to fight for a republic which doesn't even see them as human and then their deaths aren't even counted as deaths. She knows she is only talking to them to make herself feel better , she's a lot better than most other Alba but you try having your family killed because of the your color and ethnicity ,then forced to fight and have your victories never make your situation any better .",
