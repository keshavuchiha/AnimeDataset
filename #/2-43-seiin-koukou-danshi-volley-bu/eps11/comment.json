Sure there are a lot of aspects in which it is similar to haikyuu like Chika's backstory and his attitude which is similar to Kageyama. But overall the drama is great. However, they really rushed the matches. I mean I m not saying to drag a set for like 3 episodes but atleast show the match properly. Also the drama and voice acting might be good, but the animation is average and the character designs are nothing special and a bit unoriginal. For example Chika;s design is basically Tsukishima from Black market. So overall I don't hate the anime, but I don't like it either. So a 7/10 for me.\nAnd imma say it:\n2.43 is MID",
