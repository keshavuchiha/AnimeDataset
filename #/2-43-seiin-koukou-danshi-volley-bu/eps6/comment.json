        "message": "Some of y‚Äôall actually NEED TO STOP comparing Haikyuu to this anime I‚Äôm honestly sick and tired of people doing so and the only thing that backs up their argument is that both anime are volleyball related which isn‚Äôt even a valid enough reason. This anime has WAY more emotion aspects to it and shows the REALISTIC side of how volleyball and the teammates interact and their feelings and also shows how you can‚Äôt win every match you lose most of the time. Haikyuu is a good anime it‚Äôs enjoyable and I can see that some of y‚Äôall are overprotective of that , understandable but at least be realistic with your opinion and stop comparing anime with different anime that are literally so different in many aspects.",
