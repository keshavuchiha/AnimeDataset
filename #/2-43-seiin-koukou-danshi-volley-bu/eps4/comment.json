I've watched enough sports from old to new, from OneOuts to KnB to SlamDunk etc etc to know there are many facets of each game which can be explored, hell, I've been basketball shooting gaurd for 14yrs, but it's pure blasphemy if you are telling me that this is all new and fresh story. I'm sorry as much I despise to be super critics like AoT twitterati, this one is a modded rip off. They did not even allow the viewers to bask Haikyuus glory, then went ahead and straight up aired it 1 week later which quite literally deletes the only defense about finding similarities. Had they not released it right after it, maybe it would have felt good to have it all back, but now, oh no. Maybe there are people like yourself, good sire, who don't really care even if story is plagiarised through a gray zone, to legally make it seem fresh which makes you enjoy story even if they are similar with different characters and similar facets most people can't. Even if most people do, atleast I don't. And I again emphasise, there are enough facets in each game to be explored and animated for it to not just feel fresh but actually be F R E S H, and this anime is failing quite well at that atleast till the previous episode, but again not giving up on an anime is what a good viewer should do and that's what I will do. I will keep on watching and see how different it is. Good day to you, good sir.",

This anime could have given that personality to another character besides the setter but we always need that cold and aloof character along with their \"genki\" partner lead, something extremely common in many anime outside of sports.( Naruto with Sasuke and Naruto, Free! with Haru and Makoto, KnB with Kuroko and Kagami, etc etc etc)\nBut at least this genki main dude is no Hinata, he gives me more Asahi vibes in his volleyball skills if anything.",
