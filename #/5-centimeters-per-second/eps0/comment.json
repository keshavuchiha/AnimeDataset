(but they just showed takaki at the end page you'll understand what i meant when reading the manga) yayyy!! and there's so many things different in anime and the manga story (there's more story in manga that they didn't cover up in movie and so many different things as I said) , movie showed akari kinda selfish but if you read the manga akari waited for him so long but he didn't contacted him and as you can see takaki he was typing msgs but he didn't send those too. even in the last scene during the train scene, she act selfish in movie and didn't stopped but in manga we get to find that she really didn't forget him and waited years for takaki but he didn't comeback so she finally decided to move on and even in the second last chapter of manga in the train scene, she really turned back from the other side of the track and talked even for a little and when takaki find that she already moved on and got engaged, he finally decided to move on as well but I STILL DOUBT ABOUT THAT THE LAST CHAPTER OF MANGA,IF IT'S CANON OR NOT because you can't actually talk between trains passing or maybe they just made these chapters after the movie to make people happy at the at least. She did love him when they were kids but that faded away with time and she finally fell in love with a different guy but i still feel like This shows Akari was not a loyal person if we compare her character to Takaki. She could've found him if she tried like kanae did.\nAnd the manga was just fan service after the movie's ending got hatred. but for me he ended up with kanae because i don't want depression.\n(edited:- The ending depends on reader what they think honestly, that's why shinkai is great. Ending the movie at a cliffhanger.)",

It was so sad and depressing and realistic at the same time bcoz I've been in that place. I wanna share my story with y'all\nI was like 13years old , started going to tuition coz my mother can't teach well. The tuition was co-ed and had a good amount of people. I liked a girl and later confessed and somehow she liked me back. Our houses were far away from each other so our only meeting point was tuition. We held hands outside after leaving and later we tried it in the classes as well then the time came when I had to leave bcoz I was asked to go somewhere near and someone better( the one teaching me didn't know 9th class subjects well). I left that day, cried hard but later a year we met again in a mall and i asked her number and she gave it to me. We started talking on WhatsApp since she couldn't use snap and insta coz her mom restricted. Honestly my feeling got numb and there were a lot of conditions on msging her ( like i couldn't msg her first since it's not her phone , i have to keep my phone near me all day and wait for her to msg , if I was busy the moment she msged me then i gotta wait till tomorrow , we could only send msg no call or video call as well and I have to come up with topics everytime bcoz if I didn't then she would reply \" we'll talk later bye \". She had prblms and so did I. I got lazy and started ignoring her and the day came where she stopped msging me bcoz we didnt have much to talk.\nNow i dont even remember the last msg I got from her\nThis movie was a reminder of what I have lost.\n10/10 from me for being so realistic",

All that was said that was they both liked each other, met after one and a half year, kissed and never contacted each other tf. I get that they wanted to show more about the first love thing and how you want to move on and sometimes you can but in some cases not so easily but all this showed was that the guy moved away and a few letters that were exchanged by each other. There was no buildup to the kiss. Poor storytelling but this is the closest to realism it can get. Most of the time as kids we make mistakes go to such long lengths and forget about it not long after.",

We can easily tell this anime was based on the concept of moving on they both fell for each other when they were kids but as they grew up they decided to just take it as a memory and move on that's completely fine but I don't understand why the mc would be sad if he already decided not to make any move and also quits his job cuz of sadness and ignores the girl who's currently in love with her, what matters the most is present. But I don't blame artist he wanted to portray the concept of moving on sometimes moving on could be a right choice. And the scenes and animations were beyond beautiful also it was satisfying to watch such amazing visuals and overall i enjoyed this movie. I'd give it a 7/10 ig.",
