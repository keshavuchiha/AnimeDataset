So, I was sad the moment they started the flashback and felt nothing when he actually died as it was waaay too predictable. I get it... killing him without a backstory would make us feel nothing but showing the backstory when they are about to die also does not help as we don't get time to grow on that person. My best bet would be show the backstory a few episodes before, let that character generate a fanbase and then KiLL ThEM.( Shatter their hopes and dreams and maybe they'd cry)...But keeping my evil thoughts aside... the time shift in the fist episode was a very unexpected hit. The sadist knight waiting for her loved one to the point where she was extremely sad to see that she grew but not him, pulled a few heart strings.",
