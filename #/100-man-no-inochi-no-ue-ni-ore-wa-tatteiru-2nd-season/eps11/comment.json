Plus, it kinda helps me appreciate and respect the better ones even more. Although, I do agree that complaining about it all the time is unnecessary. But it's still their opinion at the of the day. So, calling them dumb won't solve anything. If you don't agree, why don't you tell them why they're wrong and why the show is good or great instead? That'll be smarter and might even make them look even dumber if you're right.",
