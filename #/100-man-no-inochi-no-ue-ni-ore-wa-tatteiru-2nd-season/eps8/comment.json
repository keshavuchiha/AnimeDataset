Like I understand the villagers having to agree with the chief. I mean he is the chief he could have killed anyone who opposes him so the villager had no choice I understand but man wtf was that execution was terrible, The hero’s didn’t even try to defend them self until blonde boy actually did something useful this entire season and that was punching the chief\nNo ones noticing little boy nothing saying or showing any emotion at all during the event.\nWtf did all the villager die ?.\nThe way that dragon or serpent came out was hilarious.\nIdk how the manga went but the group is full of pile of rocks.\nAll of them are useless only MC and Gelda or gilda what ever her name is and she just started her journey.\nEven short Brown hair girl knows that she useless iwhich is why she offer to jump the well.\nThe little boy who fought back the chief soldier, saved his future wife, and risked his life to bring her back to slavery. Honestly that boy was the *star* for this episode.",
