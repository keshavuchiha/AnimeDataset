Even my soul is tired at this point, but his voice never fails to heal me and make me want to keep on living. How did this episode give me exactly what I needed? The deep tones of my favorite seiyuu, the flashing neon lights, the distant sounds of the dangerous city and traffic outside, while safe in the lap of a nice, giving and gentle person, with the aroma of the tobacco calming me down, under a beautiful moonlit sky... it‚Äôs like a dream. Only thing that would have made this better was if the character looked at least 15 years older than he does here. It‚Äôs like someone peered into my heart when they made this. I‚Äôm so very grateful it turned out this well and glad that I waited so long for this exact episode. I hope others can have an open mind and give it a watch before skipping it just because it‚Äôs a man‚Äôs voice. And there‚Äôs a very special quality about this episode. Gives me almost Cowboy Bebop vibes with the quiet desperation I feel in these characters.",
