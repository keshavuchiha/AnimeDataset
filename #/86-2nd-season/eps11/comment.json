S1 leave me depressed and then I found out that there is S2. Straightaway watch it and already prepared my mind and soul for this season. But then ive been blessed to watch such beautiful moments in each eps with amazing characters which i hold dear in my heart. The characters are well written with brilliant development. We can see how much Lena grow as a warrior and glad she never loses her ideals and herself. As this season focus on shin as the protagonist, we could see well his point of views and how he overcome his conflicts after carrying all the burden over the past years. Two of my fav characters introduced in this season definitely are frederica and ernst. While frederica started off as kinda bit annoying character, she actually too wise for her age and her words could really penetrate shin's cold heart and made him find his reason to live and continue fighting. Ernst personality might made him looks like kinda shady with his ideals and all, but he truly stick by his ideals and performed his duty to the very best. Im glad that all the remaining characters survived and the spearhead squadron finally met their handler one. A beauty of masterpiece written and absolutely a gem for me. Bravo to all those who walk on this journey and reach up to this point. It could be an ending for some or even a beginning to something entirely new. May we meet again in the future fellow watchers. We wont forget!",
