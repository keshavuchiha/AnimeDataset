So I hope you can appreciate what we got from 86 and don't say \"oh if studio xx adapts it the fight scene will be good\" because yeah there is a chance the fight scene will be good but what will happen to the other area like the song, VA, story because there is a lot of novels that got adapted to anime that turns out not as good as the novel itself so be appreciate what we got. :)",

It's his way of dealing with all of the emotional trauma he has buried under his poker face. He's still human with a heart and experiences emotions no matter how numb he has become to them. I really hope he can heal from all that when it's over and find more happiness.",

Also the old man that took them in is sus..and he seems to feel guilty over something we dont know about yet..I feel like the federacy has something to do with the origins of the legion unless I'm thinking too deep on it",

Up until that point Kiriya had always been with frederica, protecting her. so when they gave \"proof\" she'd been killed, kiriya had decided he no longer had anything to live or fight for since what he had spent his life protectiong had been taken from him. He stood infront of a legion and did not move a it swiped his head. She blames herself because it was the misinformation of her death that lead to his becoming part of the legion. While it was out of her control, in every aspect of the phrase, she still blames herself for everything in proper anime fashion. again all of this has been explained PRIOR TO this episode, so none of this is a spoiler.\nnow this part, I'm not sure about but I've been asking people whove read the novels to help explain some extra shit for me, Frederica is the LAST surviving member of the royal family, who are the only ones who can stop or start conflict with the legion. She claims she was the one who released them but given her age and time elapsed I find that hard to believe, though the thought of a psuedo government comes to mind, in which she could have just been the proxy. regardless of the actual circumstances, its easy to see how and why she would shoulder the blame. Her regime both conceptualized and launched the legion, starting this war and causing countless deaths across the world on all sides. whether or not she was the one who did it personally doesnt matter in cases like these because humans want someone to blame and pay retribution. sometimes thats yourself, other times its the ones who let it happen regardless of intention.",

Ernst also said something \" i will destroy the world\" maybe he meant like letting himself be a legion since he leads a country when a legion takes him then its a quite a boost for legion or maybe a nuke perhaps.
