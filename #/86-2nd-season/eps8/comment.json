I'm aware it's gonna take some time for him to open up and gather the will to live through his circumstance but it was hard swallowing so many episodes without any development at all. I would argue that his character development will be a slow one, but from my observations, by the end of this season, Shin will grow as a character instead of being a suicidal empty emotional shell.",
