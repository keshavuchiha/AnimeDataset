This comes from\n1.) the Republic hasn‚Äôt established radio contact with the Giad Federacy\n2.) there is a large invasion incoming, and it wouldn‚Äôt really make sense if Giad was the only nation that the Legion attacked\n2a.) They have already been shown (for an entire season) to be continually attacking the Republic, so this invasion would likely be directed there as well\n2b.) The Legion probably wouldn‚Äôt attack two nations at the same time, as this would divert processing power between the two. Hence, I believe that the large-scale attack on the Republic has already occurred.\n3.) Shin mentions that there are not many 86 left, so the 86 being totally overrun is not implausible.",
