That's why they call them monsters, cuz they can't believe how they can defeat so many legion like this while having a smile on their face (we saw that in episode 16). They act like kids playing with toys in the park. No matter what you say, this ain't normal.

She really is just a kid after all and her whole vibe is just disturbingly childish compared to the 86 who have been through way more leading to them being more mature, grounded and more accustomed to the harsh war/ front lines environment. Maybe I'm thinking too much about it, but I don't know... Her character just annoys me a whole lot.

Does not explain why the rest of the spearhead squadron wants to die so much. LITERALLY NO ONE QUESTIONED Shin's decision to go back into metal coffins. At least one of them needs to show that they want to LIVE. I hate to compare this show to AOT but Erwin's last charge in aot clearly demonstrates the flaws of 86. When Erwin announced his suicide charge, Floch literally said, \"of were gonna die anyway then why don't we die instead running away since its all meaningless.\" These 86 literally go back because \"they feel like they don't belong there.\" Such a bs excuse and they don't justify that statement with even ONE solid reason.

Theo was talking about how they were originally chosen for the mission.. because they are 86. They're not suicidal, they're just fighting to protect like they've always did. They don't want to sit back and die like a bunch of pushovers but rather want to fight until they die.. with pride. Since the beginning of the show.. they NEVER asked for pity. Instead of being treated like suicidal maniacs (which they aren't).. they could instead be given the \"choice\" to fight first. Except Wenzel and Ernst, nobody (the top brass) gave them a choice. Despite the fact that they'd fight anyway, the point is that the federacy treated them like 86 instead of their honor to fight. They're not \"hypocrites\" bruhhh ffs how dumb can people be. They're not even trying to 'emphasize' that they're 86.. they're just saying that to make themselves feel normal. Cuz that's how they've always been treated. Wherever they were. One or two dudes treating them equally isn't enough. They also had that back in republic. But the majority of them always look at them differently. It's nothing different here. \"We were chosen because we're 86\" and \"We're going because we're 86\" are two different things. If you can't understand the difference in what Theo stated, then you're just dumb. And the other dude who posted the op comment gave a bunch of complaints that didn't make the slightest sense.

I mean, you being slow to read simple dialogue shouldn't have anything to do with the show being bad.\nAlso, an AOT fan shouldn't be complaining about these characters' ages and what they've accomplished during then.😂🤦‍♂️\n----\nAOT and 86 don't go out of their way to make this a \"kid's anime\" (unlike Naruto and other shows), it's been HIGHLIGHTED countless times that within each show, whatever they do at their young age, it isn't \"just because\", the 86 are forced into doing suicide missions since they are a different race and in AOT it's lowkey just a \"do or die\" situation.\n----\nEvery character is annoying for you? Okay buddy, go back to your AOT and please stay there. It's really a tragedy what happened to the lead characters in this show. (Being choked by a country you're giving your life for. Being a tool for a government that has no respect for human life.) And the tragedy isn't what makes the characters good, it's the way this writer made it so that they're realistic. The tragedy isn't all that they have to succeed in overcoming, there's also the mental and emotional imbalances. And thanks to the studio's care, all of the soundtracks and symbolical visuals here and there really immerses you in each of their journeys.\n----\nIn my opinion, the \"tsundere child queen\" was a good addition. The show has very dark overtones, and having her as their comrade/little sister provides needed relief.\nSorry you can't enjoy this anime.\nGrow up, learn to read, come back, and then you *might* enjoy it more😊👍",

It's what they were raised to do and if they hadn't the gov would have fallen. #3 They honour the fallen by continuing to fight \"End the War\" rather than the most experienced soldiers sit on their butt out of pity. #4 Ofc they don't want pity or peace, war and brutality is literally the only thing they have known from a young age. Most ppl can't just turn around and eat sweets watching TV and shiii after that. If anything your worse off adapting to that bc shiii will haunt you in your sleep...
