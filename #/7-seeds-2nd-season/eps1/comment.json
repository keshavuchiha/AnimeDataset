I mean Arashi is just an ordinary highschool student while Ango been training since he was a kid. If Arashi actually beats Ango then that’s just straight out bullshit. But I guess they wouldn’t let them fight against each other if they actually try and something unexpected would happen that they get distracted from fighting each other.",
