Even if the plot is literally still the same as what the synopsis says for 2 whole seasons we never get bored and development comes so smoothly. even tho its pretty light it attached to me pretty well. didnt rlly dislike anything about the anime except for the fact that it would be sad if he didnt go down the harem route which is impossible due to the setting. a solid 9/10",
