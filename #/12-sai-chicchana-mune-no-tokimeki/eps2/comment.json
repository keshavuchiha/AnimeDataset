        "message": "man i wish i got a girlfriend when i was 12, is it possible, ya it is but the only kids that might get a girlfriend that early are the type that get into trouble or there parents don't care what they do.\nif your raised in a environment where people sware and cuss around the child, play perverted rap music, there often the ones that do.\nbut most parents do care about there kids, like them going on a double date together.\nno caring parent would let them go by themselves,\nbut you have to remember this is anime. it's cute though, i kinda like Aoi and Hiyama more than the other two.\nthey definitely come across more realistic, like her wanting to hold his hand.\nthere both shy, and i gotta say Takao is kinda tall for a 12 year old, and Ayase looks younger than 12.",
