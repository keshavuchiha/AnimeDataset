        "message": "Aww this episode was so cute! I give this anime a 7.5/10, I felt like a lot of the scenes were cringe and they gave me second-hand embarrassment. But a lot of the scenes were wholesome and cute. It was pretty boring and took me a while to finish but I was able to complete it. I don't think I'll continue the other seasons for this anime for now. Maybe later considering how many other animes I need to finish. I still enjoyed it, especially watching Aoi and Hiyama moments!",
