The MC can be a soggy turd at the bottom of a carpeted public restroom, and still manage to have the confidence to say out loud he wants to kill someone. Of course who had just previously unleashed an explosive diarrhoea of death is several times the strength of this reincarnated God.\nOf course, he's a reincarnated god, naturally his arrogance would lead him to ensnare 2 \"Ice queens\" but with all his godly god stuff, he still Managed to forget his reincarnated god wife. The main character of this here donghua is like a ant that forgot its\nant trail, endlessly circling the last known purpose before his God death.\nAlas he gives up on his godly godness and his godly god wife to make an American child sized amount of enemies, He seeks revenge not on those whom had betrayed him, but those whom he angered. The endless cycle of of revenge lasting episode after episode.\nOf course not to mention the love triangle 🙄",
