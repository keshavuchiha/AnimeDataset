King cock, that guy is a piece of shit like his family and adoptive daddy‚Ä¶ crazy how she‚Äôs good. But than again technically he found a way to thaw the hearts of two of the sects infamous ice queens ü§£üòÇ both who were untouchable and unobtainable by anyone. So technically they could both be evil but since they‚Äôre in love with bruv they seem nice and sweet ü§£üòÇ just a plot twist that‚Äôs in my own head. But yeah, anyways I don‚Äôt think either girl is evil. But knowing the family they did spike her tea to mess with mu and she just didn‚Äôt know about it.",
