The fact that Akuru had to deal with her bs for the past 10 years is shocking. I didn't really like it as much as I thought I would. The characters were weird. The only normal ones were the 3 kids, the dog, Akane and her 2 friends, Akuru and Sayaka. Before I watched the show I thought that Yoshiko would be just a bit slower than the other students but she's mad dumb. This anime wasn't that entertaining or so funny that it had me in tears. But I still give it a 7.",
