In my opinion the gore scenes were a bit far-fetched and also the part Tetsuo becomes a gigantic Genital also didn't make sense. Speaking of not making sense I really didn't know why Kei was involved in this. Yes it's an Anime So I guess you should have a heroine. Clueless of her purpose in this story, I had to watch a video to assimilate the ending. Also loved the way the author potrayed Japan's economical and political status after the World war II, especially considering the movie was focusing strongly on the government and military confinements . Coming to the conclusion I give this movie a 8/10. That's just my opinion. 😀",

So the kids and Akira were the good guys and Tetsuo and the half baldy were the bad guys? Tetsuo lost himself to his own thoughts of being more stronger and better than Kaneda. This wasn't enjoyable at all since I was trying to understand what was going on. TT-TT But it wasn't bad either. The gore scenes were so intense I loved it! For an 80's work this was pretty decent. I do think that this deserves a remake, not cause of the quality but because of how a lot of scenes didn't make sense. 9/10. In my opinion, this wasn't a \"masterpiece\" but I do think that for a show like this, it was pretty gold Σ(￣。￣ﾉ)ﾉ",

        "message": "the animation quality of this film is way ahead of its time.... im not gonna say its the most philosophical nor the most beautiful story from the classic ones but i think what made this controversial and popular is its animation and quality... the movie doesnt make me feel any emotional or attachment feeling to the story at all probably because its made to be a movie and well its story cant be adapted perfectly from its main source in the manga, which is why... if you want more explanation or character development reading akira's manga would be a wise decision... i can see why it was called \"classic\" and shit and i had high expectations cause of that and now i know why it is considered legendary by most, but to me its fine.. not bad nor that good... nor mid either its probably above average... it was a jam-filled-experience i should say. It got good themes like religion, cults, beliefs which is a good topic in Japan's society... also with the effects of war, abuse of power, and the dangers of atomic bomb and shit but its up to the audience to understand those",

It promoted anime during it's infancy which enabled other future anime like dbz and one piece to become populer easily because people had seen what anime can do with akira. Also there is character development but it's like reverse development. You can see throughout the movie tetsuo gets more evil even though at first it looks like tetsuo is the main character but it's actually kaneda that's the protagonist. The movie also has alot of other themes that I don't wanna get into like religion and rebirth and how the youth isn't getting the proper upbringing in scociety. It also has themes of misusing technology which is a reference to the atomic bomb and how it was used during WW2 on japan.",
