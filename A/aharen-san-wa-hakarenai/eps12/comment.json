        "message": "3/10\nAharen-san wa Hakarenai is Komi-san wa Comyushou desu if it wasn‚Äôt trying, and even that show only really tries for a single episode. It‚Äôs a school-life gag comedy where every character is a joke, and none of them are funny. Every character is introduced and you unenthusiastically realize, ‚Äúoh‚Ä¶there‚Äôs a punch line coming here, isn‚Äôt there?‚Äù And then it comes and you go, ‚Äúoh‚Ä¶I guess that was it?‚Äù And the answer is always yes, and it always makes you roll your eyes or simply yawn. Komi-san wa Comyushou desu has a thematic core in the idea that appearances can be deceiving, and despite what you may think about someone based on their looks, their social status, and the assumptions which you may be lead to make about them based on those things, everyone has problems, and you‚Äôre never alone in your feelings of anxiety and self-doubt. It has a cast of gimmicky characters, but each one‚Äîwhether you find them funny or not‚Äîis thematically relevant because they each display an archetype which they later proceed to subvert, thus reinforcing the idea that much like Komi, the stunning beauty who everyone admires yet who has paradoxically no self-confidence and no friends, everyone is a book whom you cannot judge by the cover. This show, however, is about nothing, and no matter how many scenes of forced sentimentality and piano music it throws in to try and trick you into thinking it‚Äôs about something emotionally worthwhile or any of its characters are growing or changing, this is not and is never the case. Actually, that last bit isn‚Äôt true. The characters do grow and change, but only after the entire show undergoes a dramatic yet ultimately underwhelming evolution and becomes something totally different than it was at the start.",

The characters here are all likeable even the side characters they are all so wholesome I love them all. I am satisfied with the ending. The confession scene was perfect. The ending is perfect. They both know how they both feel with each other and they are officially a couple. Couldn't ask for a better ending. Everyone supports them and their group is so wholesome. Loving the Aharen x Raido moments. A perfect mixture of comedy, romance, cuteness and wholesomeness. I love endings like this where they are officially a couple and everything is clear.
