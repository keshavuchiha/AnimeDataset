        "message": "Hmm it doesn't seem as if they are blood related, the father seemed like he was going to tell the mc that his sister is not actually his sister but I could be wrong of course, just that the end with his father and mother made me think of this lol\nI enjoyed the anime, I think both Yuuhi and Minato are beautiful and would be happy to end up with either lol\nIdk why I thought the MC had some kind of hidden super power, perhaps because the story kind of perceived the Mc to be ?\nI loved the eechi scenes throughout the anime ;) they didn't need a censored and uncensored anime shows like how they have eechi anime shows now\nMy personal rating for this anime is 8/10 :)",
