        "message": "honestly I've heard this was a good watch but I did not expect this. Very good pacing and I adore the fact that It's not a guy chasing after the girl romance. They do it their own way and it builds character and gives a nice \"their meant to be\" feeling. The animation is enjoyable and I wish they had a after story of them getting married and all that gushy stuff. The side characters are well written and all harbor their own growth through the story, something that is hard to do. overall I'll give this anime a 9/10 only because no wedding, The message of \"going down the path you want to, and to say no to a path if necessary to get where you want to be\" is good life advice and plays so well in this romance. Defiantly worth the time to watch and I'm sure a lot of people agree with that.",

        "message": "Shirayuki is a normal herbalist in the kingdom of Tanbarun with one unique feature: her beautiful red hair which attracts a lot of attention. Due to her unusual hair color, Shirayuki was raised to always be careful of showing her hair in new surroundings, tying it up with a red ribbon and grew to be an independent, young woman. However, her hair gets her noticed by Prince Raj, who orders her to become his concubine. Refusing his orders, she cuts her hair and leaves it behind, as she knew that he only wanted her for her unique hair colour and escapes to the neighboring kingdom of Clarines. On her way there, she meets and befriends Prince Zen Wistaria and his two aides, Mitsuhide and Kiki. When Zen is poisoned by an apple meant for Shirayuki, gifted by Raj, she successfully obtains the antidote and decides to accompany the trio to Clarines. Shortly thereafter, Shirayuki passes an exam for a position to train in the palace as a royal court herbalist. Shirayuki finds a place in Clarines and carries out her duties as a court herbalist, befriending the youngest herbalist, Ryu. Prince Raj realizes his feeling towards Shirayuki and starts working hard to become and ideal prince for her. Over the course of the story, Zen and Shirayuki begin to fall in love with each other and eventually begin a romantic relationship, in spite of opposition due to their difference in social status. Later, Shirayuki promises to Zen to wait for him amidst the flowers.",

I love how she actually speaks up about her feelings towards Zen and doesn’t have this shy personality where she hides all her feelings and barely says words like other anime romances. I really wish I saw them get married 🥺🥺 they can’t just leave us hanging like this 😭😭 regardless I love them both so much and their friends. My fav would be Obi, I’d like to hang out with him because he’s got this goofy, funny personality plus his loyalty which is so wholesome to see 😭😭💞💕💘💝💖💗💓 there’s so much more I want to say but this is all I can say.
