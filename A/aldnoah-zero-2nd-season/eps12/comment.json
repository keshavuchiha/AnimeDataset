He is almost like a machine, devoid of emotion and would not be a good fit for her. I honestly feel like character development wise, Slaine was who progressed the most. However, I do not think it was good to have him stuck as a prisoner, most likely for life. He was a product of the harsh environment that he was subjected to, and made the most out of his shitty hand life had dealt. They should of let him die in the end and find peace.",

Seylum thinks Inaho important of Inaho, but in order to gain peace she needs to gain the favor of all martians. Inaho on the other hand probably think of Seylum as the only way to make peace and end the war. That is why Seylum got high priority in him. Since if ever Seylum dies the possibility of peace will never exist anymore.",
