In basketball your team has to take advantage of every weakness in each player so that you can have a better chance in winning games and he lies and says that he's off his game but in actuality he just can't score, it doesn't matter that you're his friend, in any sport you dont help the other team win it doesn't matter who is on the team, your friend, your brother, you play to win.",
