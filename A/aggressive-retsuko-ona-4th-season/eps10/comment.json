        "message": "This show is just too brilliant. Never is there a show where it keep me guessing to the end. I think the ending is fitting. Haida really did something wrong. In Japan it's culturally encouraged to step down/resigned as a self punishment. Haida is rich. He never really needs to work. For me all this time he was looking for love in this office and ultimately he find what he was looking for.",
