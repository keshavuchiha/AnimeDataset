Also i know that technically Tatsumi isn't the MC but he defo got more screen time than Akame imo and the way he died was not really \"satisfying\" for me based on the fact that he was the \"MC\" (I'm talking no last speech, no wise last words or anything, just a sentence). This isn't my first anime so i wasn't expecting a happy end or anything XD but this ending really left a bad taste in my mouth, also the way they just carried on like almost nothing ever happened like none of their friends have died. (Also the way Esdeath just snatched Tatsumi with her was kinda wierd tbh) but yeah mostly because of the end for me this is a 7/10",

But here, it seems like they thought \"Hey, shows nowadays are too scared to kill off main characters\" than that's all they did. IMO, it was a little overused for shock value and would have much preferred more development with certain characters so the deaths would have been more impactful, basically all I'm saying is that it gets too predictable after the first 3. The best example of building up a character/characters and having impactful death(s) would probably be from Assassination Classroom (Ansatsu Kyoushitsu) since all the characters are developed which leads to a truly impactful and emotional ending. (This isn't a spoiler as the first episode explains everything)",

The rebells weren't organized and the capitals Leader didn't make sense.. Why make him dense af for the whole anime and in the last ep show he understands and shows affection...

But for Akame, she is, idk, doesnt feel like she is the MC all along. But imma say this, overall, id rate this anime a straight 8/10. But sadly, its a sad anime, deaths every time :(, but thats what makes this anime unique, unlike other anime that has plot armour every time, deaths in this anime goes unexpectedly which makes this anime so sad, the favorite characters just go poof, their dead. Anyways, I enjoyed it, but I might be depressed for quite a while :/. Tatsumi's dead was unexpected, it just happened instantly, specially how his body was taken away with Esdeath, which was her way of showing her love for him.",
