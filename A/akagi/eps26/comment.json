        "message": "Its been a literal few minutes and I'm back. Turns out Akagi continues battling him for all the rest of near about 160+ chapters. (What the actual fuck?) This is one of the instances where I'll say holy shit that is way to fucking long of an arc and for it to be the ending as well. I understand why the Anime ended here. Nobody wanna see 60+ more episodes of Akagi vs the old guy whatever his name is. Warning note to y'all, the show essentially ends here, unless you're tryna read the manga with a fucj ton of chapters continuously Akagi vs the old guy where he outsmarts Akagi, then Akagi goes jokes on you I'm still alive because of [bullshit here]. Anime was very enjoyable, with Akagi being one of a kind protagonist. Sad how the show plays out though. 6/10 from me.",
