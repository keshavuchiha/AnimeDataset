You just look at how and if he notices and tries to get around it. But idk about you, but I don't think I've ever played a gambling game that wasn't rigged or completely fair from the start, that's what's so great about gambling in general, youre either the one that exploits the other or others, or the one that gets exploited",

        "message": "In gambling in the real world, you're always the one getting exploited, unless you're the one hosting the game. Whether it's casinos or bookies or market makers, they use statistics to create riskless positions for themselves where no matter how you play, they're always making money while you play. They're extremely keen on tracking the games and working out when they might have overlooked any type of advantage that was accidentally given to the player, and they'll revise the games to avoid them. You either play by the house rules, or you don't play at all. Sometimes competing bookies will offer different spreads or odds and create temporary arbitrage opportunities, but again you're never winning against them because they're making their money on fees.",
