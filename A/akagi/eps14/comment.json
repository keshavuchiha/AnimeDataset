        "message": "I like the way the story is playing out. I thought it was simply going to be new mahjong opponent but smarter each episode but the plot is actually expanding more than that. The Ironic thing is that many geniuses truly do end up dying young, a big reason for that being their high IQs making them feel no connections towards others. Many end up committing suicide. With no meaning to their life, they end up ending it, knowing their future lays nothing of importance for them. This topic has always interested me. Its even more exhilarating that Akagi is this type of character.",
