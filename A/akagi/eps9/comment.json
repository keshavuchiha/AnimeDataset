        "message": "I love the way Kaiji and Akagi's theme play out. Its cheating, but you essentially create luck for yourself. If the other doesn't see it, its their own incompetence. There's no point relying on luck, god etc because they will always be facing towards others to give out their own share of luck. At that point, you manifest your own destiny. (I hate that term because its derogatory from how Americans basically fucked on the Native Americans, but it fits so much to the theme lol).",
