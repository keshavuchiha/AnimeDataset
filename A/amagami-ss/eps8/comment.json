Plus the plot of this anime is similar, this anime focuses on the 1 mc but has 3 different timelines which shows what would happen if the mc dated other girls instead which is also the exact plot of Seiren. Hmm... Kinda suspicious.. this is either a straight up copy or just HEAVILY inspired by Seiren. ORR it could be the other way around, Amagami looks more original and it has way more episodes than Seiren sooo🤷",
