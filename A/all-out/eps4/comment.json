        "message": "'rugby is not a one man sport'\nwhy does team sport types always have this one player who wants to carry the team's victory on their shoulder? they always play as some one man show. Like Furuya in Ace of Diamond. At the beginning as a pitcher, he always played as a one man show. One Outs has also mostly been a one man show baseball with Toua-san.\nWhen you play sports and you have to play as a team, PLAY AS A TEAM!! I admit being a lone wolf is nice.....but if you have support, SUPPORT!!\nMost teams in Haikyuu is good with this, Kagami in Kuroko no Baseket wanted to be the lone wolf, the team didn't allow him and Sawamura from Ace of Diamond is also brilliant when working with the team. When you work as a team, it makes the game more interesting than seeing some one man show! we get that you're amazing than others but team work is much more appreciated.",
