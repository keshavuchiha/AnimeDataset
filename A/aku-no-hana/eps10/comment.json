        "message": "Stockholm syndrome the animation. I don't know exactly how accurate the depiction is but, man teenagers are weird. Most of their reasoning,atleast the mc's reasoning and same goes with the redhead seems so black and white and nihilistic. They think like what they think is always the truth of the world when in reality they're forgetting to consider the other side or to consider other perspectives too. The Ai uehara lookalike girlfriend is the only mature person and the one who I can better relate to tbh, she tries to understand our mc , his perspectives and the reason why he's acting like that.",
