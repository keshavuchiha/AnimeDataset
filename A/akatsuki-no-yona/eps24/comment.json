I can't hate him.

And i agree with you, he might not be the bad guy but theoretically he is the bad guy. Since Yona saw her dad got killed by him, he definitely will continue to put on the \"bad guy mask\". If they going to kill him it would probably happen somewhere at the end of the anime/manga when he fixes everything.\nThe second opinion is that the previous king might have information that might endanger him that's why he had to silence the previous king and maybe he might be working with those that had killed yona mom, if not it is strange that those group of people would stay silence after knowing that people are blaming them for something they did not do.\nIn conclusion, if its the first option then he might be playing with a double-edged sword, if not then he is probably safe, at least that is what i think.",

Without money, they can't animate the second season out. Another thing is that the author might just want to promote his/her manga that's why they only have 1 season.
