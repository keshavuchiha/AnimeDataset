I finished this anime 9 days ago, immediately continued to read the manga since I was so curious and intrigued by one of the dragons that we only get to see in the last episode or two. The manga is awesome, highly recommend. No wonder it has a higher rating than the anime, it's so good. Knowing what will happen later on, and learning more about the characters, I just had to come back and rewatch the anime and appreciate all the tiny little details that I most likely missed the first time I saw this. Yona, hands down, is by far my favourite female characters of all time. I just downright adore her development. I am obsessed with this story XD",
