But even more interesting is what that implies for the MC. She isn‚Äôt an Akudama but she has feeling for other people/creatures. She‚Äôs the ‚ÄúCanary in a coal mine‚Äù. Essentially the light that contains the dark. A bloodthirsty Executioner needs an ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù partner to keep them in check. In that context, our MC is that partner to the Akudama. It‚Äôs a really neat literary device that‚Äôs been utilized pretty well throughout this anime and I can‚Äôt wait to see the rest of these episodes play out.",
