I love these kind of eyes in any anime because they can do so much more with them in terms of emotions and feelings than the big flat blank eyes most other anime have. For me eyes and hair are by far the 2 biggest factors in whether or not i find a character appealing. 10:35 is a perfect example of what i'm talking about, no mouth, only eyes and you can feel what she's feeling",
