        "message": "Sorta confused again on some parts but I think I got the idea. Honestly, loved that we got some perspective on the other characters. So far, the story has been mostly grounded on Yukito's point of view, and getting to see Haruko behind the scenes really changed her character for me. She acknowledges that she's not a fitting parent, but tries her best to care for Misuzu. Now I'm left with some questions. What exactly was Yukito's wish? To give up his life form to be with Misuzu? If that's the case, why a crow?",
