        "message": "I am a self-taught guitarist that has been playing for 6 years now. It is very heartwarming to see a beginner giving it their all to learn guitar. Hebimori's chord switching in the air, playing outside, learning those chords are very very endearing to watch. I gave up once, because I was not improving. However, after a few months, I found a good YouTube channel which helped me improve and then reignited my passion for guitar. It is great to see that Hebimori had friends that gave good advice which helped her continue learning the instrument. 10/10 great episode.",

Easily a solid top 1 or 2 for me now since fabiniku is also so freaking good. shit legit felt like 3 minutes. Both the op and ed is amazing. The visuals is made by god and the characters are super duper ultra mega likable. Definitely gonna read the manga soon or after the anime ends this season. It'll be perfect since shoujo ai is also my cup of tea",
