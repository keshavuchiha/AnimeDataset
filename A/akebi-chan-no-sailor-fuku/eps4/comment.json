Also doesn't help that the genre at face value isn't attractive to casual anime fans. But tbh man I'm glad about it! makes me feel a little special knowing that I and my other cultured fellows noticed this beauty of work while everyone was only focused on the mainstream stuff. This will definitely be one of those anime where later down the line people will see it as a \"hidden gem\" tho just bc of demon slayer and AOT getting so much (well deserved) attention. But for now I'm glad it just feels like our little secret that we can be smug about and enjoy all this peak art and animation. Only thing bad about it is ofc if it does too bad we might not get another installment of it lol which im not even sure how much source material there is and if its enough for a s2.",

Education outside of the US is competitive in nature on all levels, even at public institutions. There are the base level schools and then ones that require entrance exams and even tuition fees.",
