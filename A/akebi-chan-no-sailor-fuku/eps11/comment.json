        "message": "could just be me but honestly it seems like akebi-chan has gotten like literally no attention this season from the majority of the anime fan base. I legit know 0 people online atm who is watching this show. I HOPE ofc this gets a s2 but sales and numbers are what matter the most. and akebi is being heavily overshadowed by AOT and Dress up darling this season along with demonslayer earlier too. and i think cloverworks would find it hard to see it as worth it to make a s2. unless the relatively small fanbase it has kills it with bluray sales etc.",
