        "message": "This anime series was very worth to watch. I watched the episodes every night, the other episodes after every 3 days. I drank one shot of liquor before watching this. Maybe it's the alcohol's influence but I was clapping my hands like a kid and I was smiling all the time! I am so happy that I got to watch this very heartwarming show titled \"Akebi's Sailor Uniform.\" This made me reminisce my high school times and I thought it is important to treasure memories such as Akebi's athletic festival.\nComment written on July 24th of the year 2022.",
